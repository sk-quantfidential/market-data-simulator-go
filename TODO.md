## epic-TSE-0001: Foundation Services & Infrastructure

### üèóÔ∏è Milestone TSE-0001.1a: Go Services Bootstrapping
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create Go service directory structure following clean architecture
- [x] Implement health check endpoint (REST and gRPC)
- [x] Basic structured logging with levels
- [x] Error handling infrastructure
- [x] Dockerfile for service containerization
- [x] Load component-specific .claude configuration

**BDD Acceptance**: All Go services can start, respond to health checks, and shutdown gracefully

### üîó Milestone TSE-0001.3b: Go Services gRPC Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: High

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement gRPC server with health service
- [ ] Service registration with Redis-based discovery
- [ ] Configuration service client integration
- [ ] Inter-service communication testing

**BDD Acceptance**: Go services can discover and communicate with each other via gRPC

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.1a (Go Services Bootstrapping), TSE-0001.3a (Core Infrastructure)

### üìä Milestone TSE-0001.4: Market Data Foundation (PRIMARY)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Enables trading and risk monitoring

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Minimal price feed generation for BTC/USD, ETH/USD
- [ ] REST API for current prices (production API)
- [ ] gRPC streaming interface for real-time feeds
- [ ] Basic price simulation with fixed spreads
- [ ] Simple volatility modeling
- [ ] Price history storage (Redis)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics for feed performance

**BDD Acceptance**: Risk Monitor can subscribe to price feeds and receive updates

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.3b (Go Services gRPC Integration)

### üìà Milestone TSE-0001.12a: Data Flow Integration
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: Medium

**Tasks**:
- [ ] End-to-end market data flow testing
- [ ] Market data delivery to risk monitor validation
- [ ] Data latency and accuracy validation
- [ ] Price feed resilience testing

**BDD Acceptance**: Market data flows correctly from simulator to risk monitor with acceptable latency

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.7b (Risk Monitor Alert Generation), TSE-0001.10 (Audit Infrastructure)

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Data Source**: Start with static price simulation, prepare for real data integration
- **Production API**: REST endpoints that risk monitor will use
- **Audit API**: Separate endpoints for chaos injection and internal state
- **Performance**: Low-latency price distribution critical for trading
- **Chaos Ready**: Design for controlled price manipulation scenarios
